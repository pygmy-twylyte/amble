# Zed Amble Script Extension

This extension provides basic language support for Amble Script in the Zed editor.

## Installation

1. Clone or copy this `zed-amble-script` directory into your Zed extensions path.
2. Restart Zed; files with the `.amble` extension will use the bundled parser and syntax highlighting.

## Development

- Queries for highlighting, folding, and indentation are in the `queries/` directory.
- The language definition points to the bundled Tree-sitter grammar.
