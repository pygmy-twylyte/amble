# Scoring rank definitions for Amble
#
# This file defines the performance rankings displayed when the player quits the game.
# Each rank has three properties:
#   - threshold: Minimum percentage (0.0-100.0) needed to achieve this rank
#   - name: The rank title displayed to the player
#   - description: A one-sentence evaluation message
#
# How It Works:
#   When the player quits, their score is calculated as a percentage of max_score.
#   The system searches from the FIRST rank to the LAST, and awards the first rank
#   where the player's percentage meets or exceeds the threshold.
#
# Customization Tips:
#   - Ranks can be in any order in this file (they're sorted automatically)
#   - You can add as many or as few ranks as you like
#   - Thresholds can be any value from 0.0 to 100.0
#   - Make sure to include a 0.0 threshold rank as the final fallback
#   - Keep descriptions to one sentence for best formatting
#
# Example: If a player scores 75/100 (75%), and you have thresholds at
#          100, 80, 60, 40, 20, and 0, they would receive the 60% rank.
#
# If this file cannot be loaded, the game uses hardcoded default ranks.
