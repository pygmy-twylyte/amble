General:

The commands listed below are a partial list covering the most common ones.
Many other actions are understood by the game and are necessary to solve some
of the puzzles, and you'll need to discover those for yourself!

Some items can be read (e.g. 'read mug', 'read log') and provide extra detail
about the game world, instructions for use, and other goodies.

NPCs can be talked to and may offer help (or refuse it!) Their moods and
actions may change depending on your game progress. You can also give them
items or take them in some cases.

Item names, character names, and directions are pattern-matched so you don't
have to type the whole thing. For example, if you want to talk to the knight,
you can type 'talk to kni' or 'talk to kn' or even 'talk to gh'.
