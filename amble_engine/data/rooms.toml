id = "boathouse-slipway"
name = "Boathouse Slipway"
base_description = "The narrow slipway runs alongside the quay and by the adjoining old timber-and-pitch boathouse, which leans a bit to one side. A skiff with a hole in its side sits on rollers near the water's edge. The boat ramp climbs back up toward the quay."

id = "fish-market-shed"
name = "Fish Market Shed"
base_description = "The fish market takes place here earlier in the day, but by this hour the stalls are shuttered and the din of frenzied dealmaking has long since died away. A trace of the scent remains along with fish scales ground into the floorboards to hint at the bustle just a few hours before."

id = "lighthouse-path"
name = "Lighthouse Path"
base_description = "Here weathered stone steps -- made slippery by mists and a healthy coating of algae -- slowly wind their way up a wind-battered cliff face toward the lighthouse. The spray in the air dampens your clothes, and a thick rope railing is all that stands between you and the crashing surf below."

id = "net-yard"
name = "Net Yard"
base_description = "Beyond a short maze of tar barrels acting as sentinels, the net yard sits tucked away from the daytime crowds. Frames stretch nets drying in the waning sunlight, while a couple of lingering netmenders apply their skill to the damaged ones."

id = "quay-square"
name = "Quay Square"
base_description = "The town square, adjoining the harbor quay. Gulls call overhead, looking for supper below. The air smells of brine and tar and frying oil. A somewhat brackish-appearing fountain with a centerpiece of frolicking dolphins decorates the center of the square. The bright turquoise awning of the fish market beckons in one direction, and a path leads around to a slipway. Over by the tar barrels, weathered stone steps wind up toward the lighthouse."
