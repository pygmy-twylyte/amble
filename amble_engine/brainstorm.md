# Brainstorming Ideas for Amble

## CODING TODOs
- add action RestrictItem -- so items can be blocked from being taken back from NPCs when appropriate (Black Knight sword)
- add Happy "you may pass" dialogue to black_knight
- need a call of some kind to check_triggers with any recognized command so state triggers can fire too.
- make Vogon Poetry readable
- dev commands to teleport (DONE), get items / achievs
- ?? add Wear command and item capability
- add something breakable and the crowbar!
- add "clean" / "wipe" item interaction

## FIXITs from runthroughs
-- make reservation book readable
-- rename abandoned game from Brains Anonymous: Pong Construction Set '84


## üß† World Concept: The AA-3B Breach & Amble's Origin

Amble Adventures is not the cause of the anomaly ‚Äî it‚Äôs the **opportunistic theme park** built on top of it.

### üìç The Real Origin
Deep beneath the facility lies **Room AA-3B**, once part of a high-energy experimental complex run by an unknown actor (e.g., Brains Anonymous R&D, or a defunct predecessor). Something went catastrophically wrong there ‚Äî a breach event that punctured the boundary between **reality and fiction**.

This unleashed a **fictional leakage effect**: characters, logic systems, genres, and metaphors began seeping into the world in **unpredictable ways**.

### üé≠ Amble Adventures: Built on Top
Seeing a commercial opportunity in the weirdness, Amble Corp acquired the site and built a guided adventure experience around it, presenting the surreal anomalies as curated content. They *don‚Äôt* understand the full scope ‚Äî they just try to monetize it.

## üßÉ Writing Guide for Content Creators

When designing **rooms, items, NPCs, or text**, consider:

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Tone
- Blend mundane corporate enthusiasm with reality-bending consequences
- Channel Douglas Adams, Black Mesa, Zork, and Portal
- Humor should coexist with genuine eeriness or mystery

### üåê Setting Consistency
- Most of the world behaves *normally*, but fiction has **bled through**
- Strange objects or logic may be rationalized in-universe (‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just the Vogon exhibit.‚Äù) ‚Äî but players may suspect deeper origin
- AA-3B references should be **indirect but recurring**

### üß© Useful Themes & Tropes
- Bureaucratic paperwork describing narrative paradoxes
- Office memos trying to define ‚Äúmeta-containment protocols‚Äù
- Vacation photos taken in places that don‚Äôt exist anymore
- NPCs unsure if they're *roles* or *people*
- Redacted elevator buttons, terminals that glitch between genres

### üìç Existing Hooks
- `guard-post` already references **anachronism**
- `room-aa-3b` exists but is unreachable (for now)
- Gonk‚Äôs family photo includes a caption referencing **AA-3B staff & families**
- `visitor_pass` and `elevator_keycard` open the way deeper into the structure

## üö™ Thematic Endgame Possibilities (for later)
- Discover Room AA-3B (or what's left of it)
- Patch or widen the breach
- Meet a version of yourself from a different fictional structure
- Choose whether to contain or embrace the seepage
