# Brainstorming Ideas for Amble

## CODING TODOs
- take handler doesn't block action on restricted items in containers
- dev commands to teleport (DONE), get items / achievs
- update giveToNpc to give more specific reasons for refusals.
- trigger action to change the .read field on an item to update displays etc
- idea: monolith room has HAL, but HAL is deactivated due to missing (removed) memory modules. Just sings "Daisy" over and over. Must find modules and replace them to talk to HAL and get access to the monolith
- monolith will induce higher intelligence state or paradox acceptance ability that will allow AA-3B access
- mechanism like window or portal -- where one can look outside the current room into another?
- ambient spinner for elevators with Muzak

## FIXITs from runthroughs / CONTENT additions
- read denials should be red
- improve formatting of shed notice in mailbox
- add warning / instruction label to read on poetry performer, and make it Initech


## üß† World Concept: The AA-3B Breach & Amble's Origin

Amble Adventures is not the cause of the anomaly ‚Äî it‚Äôs the **opportunistic theme park** built on top of it.

### üìç The Real Origin
Deep beneath the facility lies **Room AA-3B**, once part of a high-energy experimental complex run by an unknown actor (e.g., Brains Anonymous R&D, or a defunct predecessor). Something went catastrophically wrong there ‚Äî a breach event that punctured the boundary between **reality and fiction**.

This unleashed a **fictional leakage effect**: characters, logic systems, genres, and metaphors began seeping into the world in **unpredictable ways**.

### üé≠ Amble Adventures: Built on Top
Seeing a commercial opportunity in the weirdness, Amble Corp acquired the site and built a guided adventure experience around it, presenting the surreal anomalies as curated content. They *don‚Äôt* understand the full scope ‚Äî they just try to monetize it.

## üßÉ Writing Guide for Content Creators

When designing **rooms, items, NPCs, or text**, consider:

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Tone
- Blend mundane corporate enthusiasm with reality-bending consequences
- Channel Douglas Adams, Black Mesa, Zork, and Portal
- Humor should coexist with genuine eeriness or mystery

### üåê Setting Consistency
- Most of the world behaves *normally*, but fiction has **bled through**
- Strange objects or logic may be rationalized in-universe (‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just the Vogon exhibit.‚Äù) ‚Äî but players may suspect deeper origin
- AA-3B references should be **indirect but recurring**

### üß© Useful Themes & Tropes
- Bureaucratic paperwork describing narrative paradoxes
- Office memos trying to define ‚Äúmeta-containment protocols‚Äù
- Vacation photos taken in places that don‚Äôt exist anymore
- NPCs unsure if they're *roles* or *people*
- Redacted elevator buttons, terminals that glitch between genres

### üìç Existing Hooks
- `guard-post` already references **anachronism**
- `room-aa-3b` exists but is unreachable (for now)
- Gonk‚Äôs family photo includes a caption referencing **AA-3B staff & families**
- `visitor_pass` and `elevator_keycard` open the way deeper into the structure

## üö™ Thematic Endgame Possibilities (for later)
- Discover Room AA-3B (or what's left of it)
- Patch or widen the breach
- Meet a version of yourself from a different fictional structure
- Choose whether to contain or embrace the seepage
