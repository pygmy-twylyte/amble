# Brainstorming Ideas for Amble

## CODING TODOs


## FIXITs from runthroughs / CONTENT additions
- sonic screwdriver in evidence locker that must be pried open (at security station)
- sublevel 1 entrance... see if we can first block aa-3bwith black knight, then when black knight appeased, re-lock the AA-3B door with a new message
- overlays for observation-room
- add messaging to player with applied status effects and relief (status:nausea)
- VIP bathroom overlay -- poem book on back of toilet until taken.
- set goal: when portal gun opened "Find a Power Source"; when charged_battery obtained, complete goal (and "Open a Portal", complete after gun fired.)
- snowfield NPC: Husky; follows you to snow-camp; once you read journal, vanishes can be seen in various locations
- plaque 2 in snowfield down in the ice pit (new room, down rope), encased in ice, can be removed by melting or breaking the ice to read it; must build fire next to it (move dead fire from snow_camp)
- monolith will induce higher intelligence state or paradox acceptance ability that will allow AA-3B access
- once in AA-3B we'll finally get the cake
- HAL module locations:This is the Thing-infected Husky from the movie of the same name.
It will first appear in the snowfield, watch the player when they go down in the ice pit, and then roam a specified area
At this point, planned only to remain silent and stare creepily at the player
Maybe should actually follow the player whenever outside the building
  * #1: EMH knows hidden location. EMH can only show player once player finds / repairs his mobile emitter. (done)
  * #2: Vending machine...must be pried open with crowbar to reveal #2 jammed inside. Falls down in machine. Must be fished out with dental floss.
  * #3: CMOT Dibbler will trade for his mug, but only after... ??? something else
- add warning / instruction label to read on poetry performer, and make it Initech


## üß† World Concept: The AA-3B Breach & Amble's Origin

Amble Adventures is not the cause of the anomaly ‚Äî it‚Äôs the **opportunistic theme park** built on top of it.

### üìç The Real Origin
Deep beneath the facility lies **Room AA-3B**, once part of a high-energy experimental complex run by an unknown actor (e.g., Brains Anonymous R&D, or a defunct predecessor). Something went catastrophically wrong there ‚Äî a breach event that punctured the boundary between **reality and fiction**.

This unleashed a **fictional leakage effect**: characters, logic systems, genres, and metaphors began seeping into the world in **unpredictable ways**.

### üé≠ Amble Adventures: Built on Top
Seeing a commercial opportunity in the weirdness, Amble Corp acquired the site and built a guided adventure experience around it, presenting the surreal anomalies as curated content. They *don‚Äôt* understand the full scope ‚Äî they just try to monetize it.

## üßÉ Writing Guide for Content Creators

When designing **rooms, items, NPCs, or text**, consider:

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Tone
- Blend mundane corporate enthusiasm with reality-bending consequences
- Channel Douglas Adams, Black Mesa, Zork, and Portal
- Humor should coexist with genuine eeriness or mystery

### üåê Setting Consistency
- Most of the world behaves *normally*, but fiction has **bled through**
- Strange objects or logic may be rationalized in-universe (‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just the Vogon exhibit.‚Äù) ‚Äî but players may suspect deeper origin
- AA-3B references should be **indirect but recurring**

### üß© Useful Themes & Tropes
- Bureaucratic paperwork describing narrative paradoxes
- Office memos trying to define ‚Äúmeta-containment protocols‚Äù
- Vacation photos taken in places that don‚Äôt exist anymore
- NPCs unsure if they're *roles* or *people*
- Redacted elevator buttons, terminals that glitch between genres

### üìç Existing Hooks
- `guard-post` already references **anachronism**
- `room-aa-3b` exists but is unreachable (for now)
- Gonk‚Äôs family photo includes a caption referencing **AA-3B staff & families**
- `visitor_pass` and `elevator_keycard` open the way deeper into the structure

## üö™ Thematic Endgame Possibilities (for later)
- Discover Room AA-3B (or what's left of it)
- Patch or widen the breach
- Meet a version of yourself from a different fictional structure
- Choose whether to contain or embrace the seepage
