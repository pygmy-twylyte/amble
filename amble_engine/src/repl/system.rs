//! System utility command handlers for the Amble game engine.
//!
//! This module provides handlers for meta-game commands that control the game
//! system itself rather than affecting the game world directly. These commands
//! manage game state persistence, user interface settings, help systems, and
//! game termination.
//!
//! # Command Categories
//!
//! ## Game State Management
//! - [`save_handler`] - Serialize and save current game state to disk
//! - [`load_handler`] - Load previously saved game state from disk
//! - [`quit_handler`] - Terminate game session with scoring summary
//!
//! ## User Interface Control
//! - [`set_viewmode_handler`] - Change display verbosity and screen clearing behavior
//!
//! ## Information Systems
//! - [`help_handler`] - Display game help text and command reference
//! - [`goals_handler`] - Show current objectives and completion status
//!
//! # Save System
//!
//! The save system uses RON (Rusty Object Notation) format for human-readable
//! and debuggable save files. Save files include version information to handle
//! compatibility across game updates.
//!
//! ## Save File Format
//! - **Location**: `saved_games/` directory
//! - **Naming**: `{slot_name}-amble-{version}.ron`
//! - **Content**: Complete serialized `AmbleWorld` state
//!
//! ## Version Compatibility
//! - Save files include version metadata
//! - Loading mismatched versions shows warnings but attempts to proceed
//! - Version conflicts are logged for debugging
//!
//! # View Modes
//!
//! The system supports multiple display modes:
//! - **Brief**: Minimal descriptions for visited locations
//! - **Verbose**: Full descriptions always shown
//! - **Clear Verbose**: Full descriptions with screen clearing on movement
//!
//! # Goal Tracking
//!
//! Goals are dynamic objectives that can be:
//! - **Active**: Currently available for completion
//! - **Complete**: Successfully achieved by player actions
//! - **Conditional**: Dependent on game state for availability
//!
//! # Scoring System
//!
//! The quit handler provides comprehensive scoring analysis:
//! - Point-based scoring with maximum possible calculation
//! - Exploration tracking (rooms visited vs. total rooms)
//! - Performance ranking with humorous titles
//! - Detailed game statistics and achievements
