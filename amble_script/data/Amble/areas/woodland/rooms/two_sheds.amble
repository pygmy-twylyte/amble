    desc "A modest wooden shed stands alone in the clearing. It appears freshly painted and surprisingly well cared for. A plaque on the door reads:\n\n        'ARTHUR \"TWO SHEDS\" JACKSON\n         Philosopher, Composer, Owner of One Shed'\n\nA second, smaller foundation lies nearby, overgrown with weeds. A broken signpost beside it reads: 'Future Site of Shed #2 â€“ Delayed Indefinitely.' The forest is dark and dense, and the slope falls off sharply beyond the shed."
