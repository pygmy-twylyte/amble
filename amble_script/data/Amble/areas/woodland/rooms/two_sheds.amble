    desc "A modest wooden shed stands alone in the clearing. It appears freshly painted and surprisingly well cared for. A plaque on the door reads:\n[[box]]        ARTHUR \"TWO SHEDS\" JACKSON\n [[i]]Philosopher, Composer, Owner of [[u]]One[[/u]] Shed[[/i]] [[/box]]\nA second, smaller foundation lies nearby, overgrown with weeds. A broken signpost beside it reads: 'Future Site of Shed #2 – Delayed Indefinitely.' The surrounding forest is dark and dense, and the slope falls off sharply beyond the shed."
