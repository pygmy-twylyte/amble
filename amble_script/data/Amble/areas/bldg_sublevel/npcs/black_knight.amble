Little is known about the Black Knight, an Arthurian legend, except that he is never seen without full black platemail and a longsword, and that he absolutely *hates* to let people pass. If there's one thing he detests more than would-be passers-by, it's a dull blade -- if only because it makes dicing passers-by more difficult. He has never been defeated in combat, and would never admit it if he were."""
