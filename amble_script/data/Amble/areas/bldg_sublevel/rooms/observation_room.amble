    name "Field Observation Room"
    desc "Thick observation windows, long since spiderwebbed with cracks, overlook what should be Room AA-3B—but only darkness and occasional flashes of unreality appear beyond. Abandoned swivel chairs and battered clipboards litter the room. A faint smell of burnt ozone hangs in the air.\n\nA console near the glass flickers with a repeating message: 'CONTAINMENT BREACH LOGGED – STATUS: UNRESOLVED.'"
