    desc "The door opens into a swirling mass of static and fractured reality. Flickering projections of impossible geometries ripple through the darkness.

Anyone with a sense of self-preservation should probably leave immediately.\n\nA small sign by the entrance reads: 'Amble Adventures assumes no responsibility for ontological damage incurred within.'"
