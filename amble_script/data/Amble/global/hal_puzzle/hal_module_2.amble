A handwritten sign taped to the front reads: 'OUT OF ORDER - Management suggests violence.'"

    desc "Second in the trio of HAL's memory modules. Its red LED pulses gently, like a heartbeatâ€”or a warning. Through the cracked glass of the vending machine, you can see it sitting on shelf B4, wedged between what appears to be dehydrated water and a sandwich that may or may not exist. It hums faintly, and you could swear it whispered your name."

Its red LED pulses from the darkness about a foot down, resting on what looks like decades of accumulated dust, lost coins, and possibly sentient dust bunnies. The gap is too narrow for your hand - you'll need some kind of tool to fish it out."
