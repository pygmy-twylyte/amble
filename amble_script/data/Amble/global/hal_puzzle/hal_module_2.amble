# HAL Module #2 - Vending Machine

# This module will start with a generic description, so if first discovered in the vending machine (or even taken) before meeting HAL, it won't
# give the HAL puzzle away. The hal_module_2 item is modified to its true identity only after the HAL reboot sequence is initiated

# note: rather than just updating item description when it goes into the crevice, we use a separate
# HAL module Item (hal_module_2_crevice) which requires the "pluck" ability to handle. We don't want it
# to still require that ability once the player has retrieved it... so the "crevice"/"pluck" version
# is despawned when the player gets it from the crevice and it's replaced with the original (hal_module_2),
# which doesn't require "pluck" for handling. The plain hal_module_2 must have its description updated
# so it doesn't still say it's in the vending machine after retrieval.
