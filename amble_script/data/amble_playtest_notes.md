# Amble Playtest Notes 10/2/2025

## General
- [ ] now that exit directions can be strings with whitespace, spice up all of the bare N-E-S-W directions to be more descriptive
- [x] st-alfonzo-parish should be removed from ambientWoodland events, which are largely outdoorsy
- [ ] inspect/read item text style is a bit dim-looking in both default and seaside themes... brighter green/blue
- [ ] globally, when you talk to an NPC their movement activity should be frozen for a few turns -- so they don't walk away in the middle of a conversation


## Specific Locations

### intro.txt
- [x] still describes starting at inca-road location; player now starts at high-ridge

### high-ridge
- [x] convert cupcake to cake that vanishes upon attempt to eat, replaced by no_cake in inventory
- [x] weathered_plaque desc "... suggests >the< utmost ..."

### parish-landing
- no problems, but nothing happens here, unless a scheduled event happens to fire
- [x] consider moving plaque 1 here

### st-alfonzo-parish
- [x] messiah kit description - the <<...>> placement is wrong-looking
- shoe and gourd are fun for those in the know, but otherwise appear random / meaningless (good!)
- margarine is the same, alludes to yellow-snow cure... maybe get yellow-snow blindness in snowfield area and cure with it?

### two-sheds-landing
- no issues
- fallen tree puzzle functional (both solutions)

### two-sheds
- no issues
- good overlay changes as the tools are taken/dropped

### guard-post
- [x] nothing happens here except the towel realization trigger

### inca-road
- no issues

### loading-dock
- [x] supply locker -- add "examine" text regarding the highly flammable special wood
- [ ] strange liquid should be drinkable for some fun bit or hint, but can't be critical (doesn't spawn if locker broken)
- break and burn supply locker work with correct damage to internal items

### snowfield
- need the husky here as overlay or as NPC - not mentioned
- [ ] trigger the husky after the player visits the ice pit for the first time

### ice-pit
- [ ] need plaque 2 here
- [ ] have firewood stacked next to it already or need to bring from snow-camp
- [ ] light fire --> scheduled changes in description of plaque until done / legible
- [ ] description -> "window" -> "opening".

### snow-camp
- [ ] flamethrower desc formatting "Weyland-Yutani" indenting looks off

### east-of-building
- [ ] "pride of montana" funny botanical sign next to the bush
- [ ] room overlays should cycle, intermittently allowing player to see through the wall into the restaurant
