Evening on the Quay
###
Returning from a reminiscing about a long-ago birthday pool party, you find yourself sitting on a bench down at the quay, gazing out at the choppy waves while the Sun begins to sink into the horizon as twilight approaches.

After a few moments, you recall that a strange fellow said something to you briefly about a "crone" while you were daydreaming, but you weren't paying attention. Was it a warning? Looking around, you see no sign of him now.
