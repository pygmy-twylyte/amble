# Session Notes — 2025-09-07

This document summarizes the DSL and tooling work completed today so the next session can pick up quickly.

## Highlights
- Added Rooms support to amble_script (grammar → AST → compiler → CLI):
  - Rooms omit `location` in DSL; compiler emits `location = "Nowhere"`.
  - `visited` defaults to `false`; optional `visited true`.
  - Exits: `exit <dir> -> <room>` with options `{ hidden, locked, barred "…", required_items(...), required_flags(...) }`.
    - `required_flags` use flag names only (engine matches by name, ignoring sequence step).
  - Overlays: `overlay if <cond>[, <cond>]* { text "…" }` with all-of semantics (flag set/unset/complete, item present/absent, player has/missing item, npc present/absent, npc in state (named or custom), item in room).

- Lint integration extended to rooms:
  - Parses both triggers and rooms in a file.
  - Checks exit targets and overlay item/npc/room references.
  - Treats rooms defined in the same DSL file as valid during checks.
  - Friendlier messages with suggestions and line/column carets.

- Output quality-of-life:
  - Top-of-file header comment in generated TOML (source path + “do not edit”).
  - Per-entry prefix comments:
    - Triggers: `# trigger <name> (source line N)`.
    - Rooms: `# room <id> (source line N)`.

## Code Touchpoints
- Grammar: `amble_script/src/grammar.pest`
  - program accepts `room_def` alongside `trigger`.
  - Room core fields, exits with options, overlays with condition list + text.

- Parser: `amble_script/src/parser.rs`
  - New parse path returns both triggers and rooms (`parse_program_full`).
  - Captures `src_line` for triggers and rooms.
  - Parses exits/options and overlays/conditions.

- AST/Compiler: `amble_script/src/lib.rs`
  - `RoomAst`, `ExitAst`, `OverlayAst`, `OverlayCondAst`, `NpcStateValue`.
  - `compile_rooms_to_toml` for [[rooms]], exits tables, overlays array-of-tables.
  - Triggers emission now includes per-entry source comment.

- CLI: `amble_script/src/main.rs`
  - `compile`: supports `--out` (triggers) and `--out-rooms` (rooms). Mixed files emit both.
  - Output header comments for both outputs.
  - `lint`: uses `parse_program_full`, gathers refs from triggers and rooms, prints suggestions.

- Docs & Examples:
  - Rooms roadmap: `amble_script/docs/rooms_dsl_plan.md`.
  - Rooms guide: `amble_script/docs/rooms_dsl_guide.md`.
  - Trigger guide updated with “Source Comments” section.
  - README updated with new CLI usage and notes.
  - Example: `amble_script/examples/rooms_demo.amble` (mixed rooms + trigger).

## Suggested Next Steps (Post‑Review)
- Optional: `--no-comments` flag to suppress header/per-entry comments if desired.
- Lint unit tests for room ref gathering helpers (factor into testable module if needed).
- Sugar forms and ergonomics (e.g., single-line overlay shorthands) after stability.
- Consider reverse translation (TOML → DSL) later for migration.

## Quick Commands
- Compile mixed file:
  - `cargo run -p amble_script -- compile amble_script/examples/rooms_demo.amble --out /tmp/triggers.toml --out-rooms /tmp/rooms.toml`
- Lint with suggestions:
  - `cargo run -p amble_script -- lint amble_script/examples/rooms_demo.amble --data-dir amble_engine/data --deny-missing`
