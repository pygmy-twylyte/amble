# Amble Distribution Packages

Thanks for downloading Amble! Each package is self-contained—unzip the archive
and run the binaries directly from the extracted folder.

## Running the Engine
1. Extract the archive to your preferred directory.
2. Open a terminal in the extracted folder.
3. Run `./amble_engine` (Linux/macOS) or `amble_engine.exe` (Windows).

The engine looks for its data under the `data/` directory relative to the
current working directory, so make sure you launch the executable from the root
of the extracted archive.

## Suite Packages
Suite archives include the `amble_script` CLI plus the source `.amble` files
under `content/Amble`. You can use the CLI to recompile data or lint content
exactly as the Amble team does.
